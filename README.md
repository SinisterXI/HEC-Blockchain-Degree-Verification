## 📊 Financial Analysis

A detailed engineering economy analysis was performed to determine the feasibility of this blockchain solution. This includes:

- **Cash Flow Diagram**
- **Present Worth (PW)**
- **Future Worth (FW)**
- **Annual Worth (AW) with Annuity**
- **Capital Recovery Factor (CRF)**
- **Time Value of Money (TVM)**
- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
- **Net Present Value (NPV)**
- **Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)**
- **Profitability Index (PI)**

### 🔍 Analysis Details

- Initial Investment: **₨ 525,000,000**
- Annual Revenue: **₨ 125,000,000**
- Annual Operating Cost (Annuity): **₨ 77,750,000**
- Salvage Value at Year 10: **₨ 145,950,000**
- Analysis Period: **10 years**
- Interest Rate: **12%**

All computations are performed using Python (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `numpy_financial`).
